Probably the best-known LEGO sorter is Daniel West’s “WORLD’S FIRST Universal LEGO Sorting Machine” (Dec, 2019). According to Daniel, his work is inspired by Akiyuki’s “LEGO Mindstorms NXT Vision Guided Brick Sorter” (March, 2011) and Jacques Mattheij’s Sorting two metric tons of lego (April, 2017). Focusing on hardware, all three machines show a similar four stage design:

Bulk storage → Part separation → Classification → Sorted storage

The following overview will look at a larger field of machines and show the creative variety in designing each stage.
